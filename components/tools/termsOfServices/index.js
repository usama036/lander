                        These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules
                        posted by us on the Services or in respect to the
                        Services constitute the entire agreement and
                        understanding between you and us. Our failure to
                        exercise or enforce any right or provision of these
                        Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right
                        or provision. These Legal Terms operate to the fullest
                        extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of
                        our rights and obligations to others at any time. We
                        shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage,
                        delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our
                        reasonable control. If any provision or part of a
                        provision of these Legal Terms is determined to be
                        unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part
                        of the provision is deemed severable from these Legal
                        Terms and does not affect the validity and
                        enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no
